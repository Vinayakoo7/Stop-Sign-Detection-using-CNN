**Stop Sign Detection with VGG16 CNN Transfer Learning**
This GitHub repository showcases an implementation for training a Convolutional Neural Net model on top of a pre-trained VGG16 base model using PyTorch aided by Computer Vision Learning Studio (CV Studio) and Pillow for the specific task of stop sign detection in images. The project is centered around transfer learning, leveraging pre-trained CNN models to enhance the classification of stop signs.

Overview
Stop signs are crucial elements in traffic regulation and safety. This project addresses stop sign detection using a CNN architecture built upon a pre-trained VGG16 base model. Transfer learning is employed to leverage the knowledge gained from the vast dataset used to train VGG16. By fine-tuning the model on stop sign images, we enhance its capability to accurately detect stop signs in various contexts.

**Features**
Utilizes transfer learning with VGG16 for stop sign detection.
Implements CNN architecture using PyTorch.
Includes Computer Vision Learning Studio (CV Studio) for efficient model training.
Utilizes Pillow for image processing and manipulation.
Provides an independent Python program to test the trained model with custom images.
**Usage**
Obtain the pre-trained model from Google Drive or train a new model using the provided scripts.
Test the trained model using the independent Python program included in the repository. You can add your images for testing.
Integrate the trained model into your application for stop sign detection.
